- Dependencies configured: ✅ Implemented
- Middleware implemented: ✅ Implemented
- URL patterns configured: ✅ Implemented
- Health monitoring: ✅ Implemented

## Handoff for Next Milestone
### Dependencies for Next Milestone
- Django project structure is ready
- All apps are created and configured
- Database is set up and migrations applied
- Middleware is in place for visitor tracking
- API structure is prepared for endpoints

### Known Issues/Limitations
- Using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL (will be addressed in production setup)
- Some dependencies (psycopg2, tiktoken) had compatibility issues with Python 3.13
- Redis configuration is set up but not tested (requires Redis server)

### Configuration Notes
- Environment variables template created in `env.example`
- Django settings configured for development
- Virtual environment activated with `source venv/bin/activate`
- Database migrations applied successfully

## Next Milestone Ready: MILESTONE_1_2
**Focus**: Complete Models Implementation
**Next Steps**: 
1. Implement all database models (Profile, Project, Visitor, etc.)
2. Set up model relationships and constraints
3. Create database migrations
4. Configure admin interface
