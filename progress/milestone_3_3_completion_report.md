- **Education Analysis**: Education level matching and requirement validation
- **Recommendation Generation**: Actionable recommendations based on analysis results
- **Caching System**: Redis + database caching for performance optimization

### Skills Matching Algorithm
- **Exact Matching**: Direct skill name comparison
- **Substring Matching**: Partial skill name matching (e.g., "SQL" matches "PostgreSQL")
- **Case Insensitive**: Handles different capitalizations
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Intelligent skill relationship detection
- **Confidence Scoring**: Match confidence based on years of experience and proficiency

### File Processing
- **PDF Support**: PyPDF2-based text extraction from PDF files
- **Text Files**: Direct text file processing
- **DOCX Support**: Basic DOCX file handling
- **File Validation**: Size limits, type validation, and error handling
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted or invalid files

### API Features
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking job analysis with configurable timeouts
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests per hour per anonymous user
- **Timeout Handling**: 15-second timeout with graceful fallback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Visitor Integration**: Job analysis tied to visitor sessions for analytics
- **Response Caching**: 1-hour cache for identical job analysis requests

### Analysis Results
- **Match Scores**: Overall, skills, experience, and education percentages
- **Match Levels**: Excellent (90-100%), Good (70-89%), Fair (50-69%), Poor (0-49%)
- **Skills Analysis**: Matched skills, missing skills, and skill gaps
- **Experience Analysis**: Years comparison and gap identification
- **Education Analysis**: Degree level matching and requirement validation
- **Recommendations**: Priority-based actionable recommendations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Job Analysis Service Features
- **Model**: gpt-3.5-turbo for job details extraction (with fallback)
- **File Processing**: PyPDF2 for PDF, direct text processing for TXT/DOCX
- **Skills Matching**: Fuzzy matching with exact and substring comparison
- **Caching**: 1-hour Redis cache for identical requests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation without OpenAI API key

### API Architecture
- **Async Processing**: asyncio and sync_to_async for non-blocking operations
- **Timeout Management**: 15-second timeout for job analysis
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests/hour per anonymous user
- **File Validation**: Size and type validation with proper error responses
- **Visitor Tracking**: Integration with visitor session analytics

### Performance Optimizations
- **Response Caching**: Redis + database hybrid caching
- **Query Optimization**: select_related and prefetch_related for efficient queries
- **File Processing**: Efficient text extraction with error handling
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking processing for better user experience

### Error Handling
- **File Errors**: Size limits, type validation, corruption handling
- **API Errors**: Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 408, 429, 500)
- **Processing Errors**: Graceful fallback responses
- **Timeout Errors**: Informative timeout messages with retry suggestions
- **Validation Errors**: Clear error messages for invalid input

## Handoff for Next Milestone
### Dependencies for Next Milestone
- Complete job analysis API ready for frontend integration
- File upload functionality operational
- Skills matching algorithms validated and working
- Analysis result storage and retrieval system operational
- Visitor analytics integration complete
- All job analysis functionality tested and validated

### Known Issues/Limitations
- OpenAI API key not configured (will be needed for production)
- Using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL (will be addressed in production setup)
- Some advanced features require API key for full functionality
- DOCX processing is basic (could be enhanced with python-docx library)
- Rate limiting is basic (could be enhanced with more sophisticated algorithms)

### Configuration Notes
- Environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` needed for full functionality
- All services gracefully handle missing API key
- File upload limits: 10MB maximum, PDF/TXT/DOCX supported
- Job analysis timeout: 15 seconds maximum
- Cache timeout: 1 hour for analysis results
- Rate limiting: 30 requests/hour per anonymous user
