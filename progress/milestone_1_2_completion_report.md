  - `ai_services/migrations/0001_initial.py` - AI services models
- Models added: 15 total models across 6 apps
- Schema changes: All migrations applied successfully to SQLite database

## Model Relationships Implemented
- **Profile** → **Project** (One-to-Many)
- **Project** → **ProjectImage** (One-to-Many)
- **VisitorSession** → **PageView** (One-to-Many)
- **VisitorSession** → **VisitorInteraction** (One-to-Many)
- **VisitorSession** → **Conversation** (One-to-Many)
- **VisitorSession** → **JobAnalysis** (One-to-Many)
- **Conversation** → **Message** (One-to-Many)
- **Project** → **Conversation** (One-to-Many)
- **JobAnalysis** → **SkillsMatch** (One-to-Many)
- **JobAnalysis** → **JobRecommendation** (One-to-Many)

## Testing Results
- Django system checks: ✅ PASSING (0 issues)
- Database migrations: ✅ APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY
- Model creation: ✅ ALL MODELS WORKING
- Model relationships: ✅ VALIDATED
- Helper methods: ✅ TESTED AND WORKING

## Business Requirements Met
- Profile model with skills and experience: ✅ Implemented
- Project showcase with images: ✅ Implemented
- Visitor tracking and analytics: ✅ Implemented
- AI chat conversation system: ✅ Implemented
- Job analysis and matching: ✅ Implemented
- RAG system document chunks: ✅ Implemented
- Proper model relationships: ✅ Implemented
- Database constraints and indexes: ✅ Implemented

## Handoff for Next Milestone
### Dependencies for Next Milestone
- Complete database schema is ready
- All model relationships are established
- Database migrations are applied
- Models are tested and validated
- Pillow dependency is installed for image handling

### Known Issues/Limitations
- Using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL (will be addressed in production setup)
- pgvector support is prepared but not active (requires PostgreSQL)
- ImageField requires Pillow (now installed)
- Some model fields use JSONField for flexibility (may need optimization later)

### Configuration Notes
- All models use UUID primary keys for better security
- Proper database table names configured (e.g., 'core_profile', 'projects_project')
- Model indexes created for performance optimization
- Foreign key relationships properly configured with CASCADE/SET_NULL
- JSONField used for flexible data storage (skills, experience, etc.)

## Next Milestone Ready: MILESTONE_1_3
**Focus**: Admin Interface Setup
**Next Steps**: 
1. Configure Django admin for all models
2. Create custom admin views and fieldsets
3. Set up inline admin for related models
4. Add sample data through admin interface
5. Test admin functionality
